# Pad_Net
## One Time Pad Based Network Protocol For Sirius Security

## Outline:

This will be more memory-use intensive.

The goal is for every 'user' profile to have a separate (account of) one-time pads.

A. You cannot simply 'gain access'
B. You cannot 'decrypt' traffic



#### block of chunk of packet size has various issues:
- efficiency (larger chunk is less efficient)
- security of 'meta-data' (smaller chunk is less opaque)


Possibly a way to audit network traffic by 'user.'

#### "Layers"
'where' the protocol sits:
- in local 'router' on top of normal TCPIP
- custom packet protocol
- AWS sidewalk 'onion' type system
